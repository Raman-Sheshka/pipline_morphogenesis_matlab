%% Alternative Step - Manual correction
% Allows user correction of the segmentation. 
% Key usage:
% [ a ] - display/hide added junction
% [ d ] - display/hide deleted junction
% [ b ] - contrast modifier
% [ s ] - display/hide color patches if FinalProcessing is done
% [ j ] - jump to the specific frame number
% [ o ] - change deletion tool size
% [ l ] - lock/unlock interface
% [ h ] or [ p ] - "hand" mode to move image at constant zoom
