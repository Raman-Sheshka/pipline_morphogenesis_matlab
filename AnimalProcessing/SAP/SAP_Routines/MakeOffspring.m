%% History

% 09/01/2018: 1.4
% - initializes "cellANsOffspring" as empty array with RIGHT amount of
% columns (otherwise empty output "[]" will cause bugs in "ismember")

% 30/06/2015: 1.3 became "OffspringMaker" then "MakeOffspring"
% - removed warning "Offspring_Maker warning: empty list of cells!"

% 24/04/2012: 1.2
% - replaced warndlg by simple display in workspace

% 09/02/2011: creation from "Lineage_Generator"
