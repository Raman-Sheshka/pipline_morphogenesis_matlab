%
% Ipixel = PixelIntensity(rawImage, pixelIndex, dilation)
%
% Inputs:
% - raw_image: fluorescence image in grey levels
% - pixel_index: LINEAR index of pixel in image
%
% NB: pixel_index must have been determined on an image having SAME SIZE as "rawImage"
%
% Outputs:
% - Ipixel = mean intensity over pixel and its vicinity defined by "dilatation" which is the number of pixels
