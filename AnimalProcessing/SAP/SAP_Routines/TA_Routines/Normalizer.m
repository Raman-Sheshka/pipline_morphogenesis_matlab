%% History %%

% 29/05/2015: 1.4
% - introduced a threshold at 0.01 below which Aout values are set exactly to 0. This is to avoid plotting huge circles that are almost
% transparent.

% 20/04/2015: 1.3
% - all NaNs values in Aout replaced by 0s since Normalizer aims at providing matrices of weights in [0 1]

% 20/03/2015: 1.2
% - added argument "method" and renomalization by mean and max
% - now always setting AinTF locations to 1

% 03/03/2015: 1.1
% - checks that there is at least one value at 1 in AinTF that can be used for renormalization, otherwhise let Ain
% unchanged
