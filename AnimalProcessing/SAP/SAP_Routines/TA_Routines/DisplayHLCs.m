% - adjustments to match new notations in AIA_parameters 5.4 and TA 2.2.1

% 30/04/2015: 3.2

% - support of Lagrangian grid

% 04/03/2015: 3.0 & changed name to "HLCdisplay"
% - supports GRID mode (Eulerian)
% - many changes to make it run with TA 2.0.7

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NEW FRAMEWORK RENORMALIZATION (TA 2.0+)%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 18/02/2015: 2.2
% - In "InfoPlotter", added killTr (=0) as 3rd argument, and scalebar_width (used to be []) everywhere

% - look for "2.1" in the code to see changes

% 02/08/2014: 2.0 Display for Lagrangian grid!
% - display of patches boundaries in color specified by "grid_color" in AIA_info (using parameter "fader" with "Blend" function)
% - tensor are plotted at centroid of moving patches using "Lcentroids"
% - replaced 'Balance Error' by 'BE'

% 22/07/2014: 1.4
% - extensive use of "filesep" for mac compatibility

% 08/04/2014: 1.3.5
% - use of "print_resolution" that was stored in SAVE structure but not used ('-r200' was always used instead!!)
% - removed some commented old parts

% 04/04/2014: 1.3.4
% - display of midline under tensor display using Midline_Plotter

% 03/04/2014: 1.3.3
% - adjustments to run with latest version of Tensor_Plotter (1.7) that now uses parameter "sign_opacities" to display
% black/white disks according to sign of tensor isotropic part and with variable opacity

% 10/03/2014: 1.3.2
% - use of "Info_Plotter" for both tensor AND half-link plots

% 28/01/2014: 1.3.1
% - small adjustments to match new version of Scalebar_Plotter (v 1.3)

% 24/12/2013: 1.3
% - adjustments to match new version of Tensor_Analysis (Tensor_Plotter_BETA_1.5 that became 1.6)
% - removed variable "full_tensor_type" to only use variables defined in AIA
% - now uses "sign_tag" to plot OPPOSITE values of tensors when 'sign_tag' = '-' (it's ALWAYS the + values of tensors that are stored though)
% - display of time APF instead of frame numbers
% - now indicates in images which eigenvalue is represented by the bar (+ or -)
% - added "scale_ratio" values in filenames
% - improved display of information
% - if "TA_signs" is empty, all contributions are plotted as such (i.e. with + sign)
% - added "signs" in output filenames when "TA_signs" is not empty
% - changed naming of pdf when using centered average so that pages could be appended for each contribution (look for mean_addon).

% 13/06/2013: 1.22
% - solved bug when using TA display in AIA_runner "average" mode by checking for existence of "AIA_runner_call" parameter

% 16/11/2012: 1.21
% - now display faded segmented image below tensor ellipses instead of white background and display frame number shown

% 10/05/2012: 1.20
% - included choice of tensor contributions to plot in AIA_parameters (parameter "tensor_list" in SAVE) (GRID MODE ONLY).

% 08/05/2012: 1.19: FINALIZED SLIDING TIME-WINDOW IMPLEMENTATION
% - added display of average frame number when using centered cumulative data
% - adjustments to support grid display with new type of cumulated data (centered vs classic)

% 08/05/2012: 1.18: sliding time window on full image ok
% - adjustments to TA 1.2.0 and new type of cumulated data (centered vs classic)

% 04/05/2012: 1.17
% - uses "filename_TA" loaded from SAVE to name files after "M/OM" and PIV grid size.
% - fixed mistake: "min_Q_ratio" to "1/min_Q_ratio" in "Scalebar_Plotter"

% 02/05/2012: 1.16
% - added "&& strcmp(HL_display,'none')" in if statement for Grid processing (CASE 2) to prevent wrong overwritting of
% ellipses/bars on grid when "HL_display" is not set to "none" in AIA_parameters. Indeed "TA_Display" is then called 2
% additional times for Half-Link display in "Tensor_Analysis", whereas ellipses/bars should only be drawn when first
% called by line "TA_Display(image, GRID, [], [], [], HLC_plotstyle, TA_plotstyle, SAVE, n, 'none',tensor_display".
% - added scalebar display in original image (distance)

% 27/04/2012: 1.15
% - reverting some changes made specifically for Dachs paper

% 13/02/2012: 1.14: LAST VERSION USED FOR DACHS PAPER
% - adjustments to make parameter "tensor_display" (in AIA parameters) also relevant for full image plot
% - emphasize R+/- HL categories by increasing link_width

% - added macrochaetes display
% - added a 10?m long scalebar to scale images

% 06/02/2012: 1.12
% - removed input "std_TENSORS" and look into "TENSORS" for field "ERRORS"
% - added if sections involving parameters "grid_display" and "scale_ratio"

% 1/02/2012: 1.11
% - added input "std_TENSORS" to display differently values above or below threshold

% 1/02/2012: 1.10
% - adjustments to match "Tensor_Plotter" 1.3 (added cases "deviatoric+" or "deviatoric-")

% 31/01/2012: 1.9
% - adjustments to match Tensor_Plotter 1.2 (extra input "tensor_type" stored in SAVE)
% - grid use: created subfolders "Tensor_raw/deviatoric" now
% - grid use: added "tensor_type" in title to know whether one's plotting raw or deviatoric part of tensor
% - added option text(...,'Interpreter','none') to avoid messed up animal names that used to be latex interpreted

% 30/01/2012: 1.8
% if n_interframes == 1, will append ALL tensor contributions into one single pdf

% 25/01/2012: 1.7
% - introduced "plot_Animal" to display on images (default: plot_Animal = Animal)
% - moved parameters: "font_size", "point_size", "line_width", "EV_styles" to AIA and now stores them in "SAVE"
% - allowed overwritting of pdfs for display of tensor ellipses over grid ALSO when (exist('AIA_call','var') && AIA_call == 1)
%
% 23/01/2012: 1.6
% - adjustments for replot mode support

% 19/01/2012: 1.4
% - reduced number of inputs: now always call "SAVE" that contains all required info (including "tensor_scalebars")
% - now always left justifies ALL scalebar values.

% 16-18/01/2012: 1.3
% - use of "export_fig" instead of print
% - finalized representation of both main and main_cumul quantities
% - added "EV_styles = {'-' ':'} in parameters
% - saves tensor ellipses in appended pdfs with "export_fig" in "Tensors" subfolder
% - added "n" as input paramater
% - displays frame # in lower left corner of image
% - plots only selected type of ellipses (main, main_cumul)

% 16/01/2012: 1.2, 1.3
% - now loading structure "SAVE" containing required info to save files from this function AND frame number "n".

% 12/01/2012: 1.1
% - adaptation for grid support

% 26/11/2011: 1.0 becomes "TA_Display"
% - displays tensor ellispes and axes (main instantaneous AND cumulated contributions) next to "image"

% 22/11/2011: 1.1

% - added "all_Wijs" and "link_width" as input parameters
