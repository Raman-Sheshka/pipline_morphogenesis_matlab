%% History %%

% 26/07/2018: 2.0
% - fixed major MISTAKE where daughter ANs were stacked in a sloppy way,
% NOT matching their mother RNs in each row, therebey leading to NON
% matching daughter RNs in "ioiMatch" matrix!!! This was due to a bad use
% of "MakeDaughters" ouputs, that provides separate matrices of sisters set
% #1 and sisters set #2, as opposed to "Daughter_Maker" that used to yield
% sister ANs in consecutive rows.
% - also improved other parts of the code

% 19/12/2017: 1.3 changed name to "ioiMatcher" 
% - adjustments to use "MakeDaughters" instead of "Daughter_Maker"
% - updated variable names
% - removed commented part

% 26/11/2011: 1.2
% changed name to "ioi_Matcher" from "RN_Match"

% 16/11/2011: 1.1
% - added "kosk_match"

% 15/11/2011: creation
% - possibility to process a list of RNs now
