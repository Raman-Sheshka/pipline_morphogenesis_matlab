%% History %%

% 19/12/2017: 1.5 changed name to "iioMatcher"
% - adjustments to use "MakeMothers" instead of "Mother_Maker"
% - updated variable names
% - removed commented part

% 26/11/2011: 1.4
% changed name to "iio_Matcher"

% 24/11/2011: creation,1.3
% - fixed bug when "is" contained a new daughter (one RN listed in "Daughter_cells") coalesced with another cell that is
% not a dauhgter that just appeared in this frame (ONLY mother ANVS were looked for before, now both mothers AND
% daughters ANVS are).

% 16/11/2011: creation,1.2
% - added output "iios_match" without using any loop!

% 15/11/2011: creation,1.1
% - possibility to process a list of RNs now
