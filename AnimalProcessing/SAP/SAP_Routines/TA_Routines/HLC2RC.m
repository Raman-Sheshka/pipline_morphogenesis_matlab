function RC = HLC2RC(all_ij_match, all_HLCs)
%
% Determines structure Region Category RC (Clist = {'C';'R';'D';'A';'J';'N';'F';'Jb'}) based on Half-Link (HL) Category.
% NB: 'R' is just to have similar structure as "HLCcounter", but here no region is tagged "R" and nR always = 0.
%
% Inputs:
% - all_ij_match: nlinks x 2 matrix containing each region RN (i) (col 1) and all its neighboring region RNs (js) (col 2).
%                 Each region RNs in col1 is repeated as many times as its neighbor number.
% - all_HLC: nlinks array containing one of the category listed in "HLC_plotstyle".
%
% Output:
% structure "RC" (for Region Category) that contains:
% - all_RNs: nregions vector
% - all_RCs: nregions array containing category of each region 
% - nP: number of cells associated to process P = C,D,N,A,F,J,Jb, as well as nSum, the sum of all nP, and nTot, the
% number of cells that are not tagged 'n/a' in all_RCs.
%
% NB: all_ij_match contains RNs ALL regions RN in the image/box, NOT JUST THE CORE REGIONS. That's "all_HLC" contains
%     the info regarding the core regions.
%     all_HLC:      contains 'n/a' for all cells that are Non-Core in CURRENT FRAME
%     all_HLC_old:  contains 'n/a' for all cells that are Non-Core in OLD FRAME
%     Note that some Core_old will become Non-Core in current, and conversely, some Core in current were Non-Core in old frame,
%     these will be contributing to Jout and Jin, respectively (unless they're involved in fusion, division...)

%% Determining all_RCs %%

all_RCs = cell(nRNs,1);
all_RCs(:) = {'n/a'};       % default filling with 'n/a'

% NB: the order in which all_RCs get filled can be important because each region has several links and each can be
% associated to a different category. However, cell biological events trump rearrangements and flux (which should be
% still visible thanks to the neighbor 1/2 links). Fusion trumps everything. Hence the ordering of categorization that
% follows:

% Fusion: MUST BE CARRIED OUT IN FIRST!

F_RNs = unique(all_ij_match(Fij_TF,1));
F_RNs_TF = ismember(all_RNs, F_RNs);    % finds those RNs in all_RNs list
all_RCs(F_RNs_TF) = {'F'};
% NB: put in first because trumps every contribution in all_HLCs => cell links are impacted by its coalesced neighbor
% Ex: cell i is new, all ij were assigned tag "N", except with coalesced neighbors, tag "F" => if put in last, even
% non-coalesced cell will be found as "F" if they just have a single coalesced neighbor.
% Ex: cell i is not coalesced BUT was in previous frame => tagged with F
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


% Boundary flux (trumps box flux) (moved up in 1.2): MUST BE CARRIED OUT IN SECOND!

J_RNs_TF = ismember( all_RNs, J_RNs);    % finds those RNs in all_RNs list
all_RCs(J_RNs_TF) = {'J'};
% NB: if input is "all_HLC_old", J is a Jout; if "all_HLC", J is a Jin
% NB: J tags can only come from region switching from or to Core, NOT FROM NEIGHORS.

% NB: Conserved vs Flux (updated 1.2)
% - WHEN Remove_CoreFLHLs = 0:
% Flux only comes from regions evolving from or to being "Core_cells": then ALL 1/2 links of the regions are J- or J+.
% => Regions that remained Core cannot have any HL tagged "J": conserved neighbors are "B", new ones are "R+" even if
% this new neighbor just became Core (and will have its own HL tagged "J"), or "F" if the neighbor region is coalesced.
%
% - WHEN Remove_CoreFLHLs = 1:
% The HLs of regions not directly involved in flux (core remaining core) BUT INVOLVING THEIR NEIGHBORS that go from core
% to FL have been overridend with J- => those regions have only SOME HLs tagged J-, unlike regions directly involved in
% flux => important to let the other processes override J for these cells and put J before the others.

%% History 

% 27,31/03/2015: 1.4
% - introduction of G, A+/-, N+/-, TA- and TN+

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INTRODUCTION OF A+/-, N+/-, TA- and TN+ (TA 2.1+)%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 17/03/2015: 1.3
% - added 'R' in Clist with to mirror "HLCcounter" variables. Here no region can be tagged R and nR always = 0.

% 05/03/2015: 1.2

% 27/02/2015: 1.1
% - when looking for conserved cells added research of HL tags corresponding to topological events *OF NEIGHBORS*!!!

% 21/02/2015: creation & test on full scutellum WT2NEW:
% - checked that number of conserved region is the same with all_HLC or all_HLC_old
% - checked that keeping or removing Core-FL HL did not changed numbers for any process, as it should since we are
% defining REGION properties that must be robust to the number of HL considered for this REGION.
% - tested on 124x124 grid for Jb => solved many bugs thanks to that (nConserved not matching in old and current box, total
% number of cells not matching the number of lines in "all_RNs" when using a box not touching image frame)
% - checked that nSum = nTot and nC_old (from all_HLC_old) = nC_current (from all_HLC) on the whole scutellum movie!
