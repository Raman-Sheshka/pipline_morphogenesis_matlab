% Will replace each Region Number RN in matrix "cellRNs" by its Region
% Feature ('areas','anisotropies',...) from SIA backup.
% If "cellRNs" is a nxm matrix and Q is a p-element vector, then "cellQs"
% has dimensions nxmxp.
% If "cellRNs" is a nx1 (* OR 1xn *) vector and Q is a p-element vector,
% then "cellQs" has dimensions nxp.
%
% NB: "cellRNs" may contain NaNs; string "quantity" must be listed among
% structure "CELLS" fields; The cell "quantity" must be a scalar or tensor
% in vector form (namely [Qxx Qxy Qyx Qyy]) for each cell.
%
% Example: divCellAreas = RNs2Qvalues(divCellRNs, CELLS, 'Areas');
