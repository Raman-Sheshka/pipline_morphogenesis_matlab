function TrQ = TraceMatrix(Q)
%
% Q is a ny*nx cell array either containing in each compartment 1x2 vectors of eigenvalues ("Es" array),
% or 1x4 vectors of cartesian coordinates ("XYs" array) (or empty compartments.
% TrQ is ny*nx matrix of the trace of each compartment, namely Es(1)+Es(2) or Qxx+Qyy.
% NB: uses fuction cell2mat3D.
