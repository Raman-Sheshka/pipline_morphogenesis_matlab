%% History %%

% 15/05/2013: 0.2, 0.3
% improved detection of filter by preventing fake detection on image borders:
% - removing bottom right pixel of image I (that is always found when it is 1) from varagout (0.2)
% - removing border pixels (right and bottom borders) of image I from varagout (0.3)
% - changed name to "fourpixelblocKdetector"
