%% History

% 26/04/2018: 1.5 (stephane)
% - add 4-conn option (default is 8-conn)

% 22/01/2018: 1.4
% NB: when commenting the filling of "allIndSideDilated" in the loop, goes from 7.5s to 3.5s!!!
% - tried several ways to fill it, but they all seem equivalently slow
% - removed outputs I,J corresponding to "indSideDilated"

% 22/01/2018: 1.3
% - NB: went from 8.5 to 7.5s (tested by performing background removal wt2NEw on frames #8,9 on my MacBookPro)...
% - to achieve this, went back to linear indices (rather than I,J)

% 22/01/2018: 1.2 
% - NB: went from 11s to 8.5s (tested by performing background removal wt2NEw on frames #8,9 on my MacBookPro, intDilati)...
% - to achieve this, when iterating, NOW only dilates NEW pixels that were just created during previous iteration
% - now mostly works on IJ couples rather than linear indices

% 09/06/2016: became "SideDilator"

% 09-10/06/2010: creation
