%
% [arclengthValues, sideIndicesSorted, closedContour] = Arclength(imageSize, sideIndices, baseIndex, scale)
%
% Calculates arclength values of a skeletonized list of connex pixels (conn
% = 8) for an open or closed contour from the specified base pixel index.
%
% INPUTS:
% - imageSize (1x2 matrix)
% - sideIndices = list of linear indices making up the contour
% - baseIndex = index where arclength calculation will start (arclength =0). Must be part of the contour (closed) and one of the 2
%              endpoints(open). If empty, 1st index of "ind_side" (closed)/ind_endpoints(open) is assigned.
% - scale = size of one pixel (unit �m/pixel). OPTIONAL. DEFAULT = 1 �m/pixel.
%
% OUTPUTS:
% - arclengthValues = vector containing arclength values in ascending order (starts at 0)
% - sideIndicesSorted = list of pixel indices from "ind_side" but sorted in ascending order of arclength
% - closedContour = boolean specifying if the contour is closed or open
%
% NB: max(Arclength(...)) returns the total arclength of the side
%
% KNOWN BUGS:
% - doesn't work for a closed contour with "bubbles" trapped inside
% because then there are 2 equivalent neighboring pixels comming next
% (update: not exactly equivalent: one should be a vertex) (ex: cell 48 of
% modified image "Unionseg_mod_p7_0001.png")

%% History

% 24/01/2018:
% - added boolean "closedContour" as output

% 07/07/2010: 1.3
% - REMOVED output "image_arclength" to make it faster (image of contour
% with arclength values at each corresponding pixels (background = NaN))
% Removed in the code:
%    image_arclength = NaN(image_size);
%    image_arclength(ind_side_sorted) = arclength_values;

% 01/07/2010: 1.2
% - systematic notification when closed contour is found
% - for closed contour, the first pixel (ind_base) will now store the last
% (and actual) value of arclength instead of 0. arclength_values then
% starts with value 1 and not 0 and ind_base ends up being the LAST index
% listed corresponding to total contour arclength.

% 29/06/2010: 1.1
% - default assignment of first endpoints (open contour) or pixel index (closed
% contour) when ind_base was left empty
