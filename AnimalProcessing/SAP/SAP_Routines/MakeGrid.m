%
% GRID = MakeGrid(imageSize, boxSize, xyStart, gridSize, gridColor, gridLineWidth, gridOverlap)
%
% This generates a grid (no display as of 1.4, use "Grid_Plotter" to do that) made of boxes of width
% "boxSize(1)" and height "boxSize(2)" IN PIXELS, and overlap between compartments ("gridOverlap"). The
% grid is defined starting with upper left corner at coordinates "xyStart" of grid upper left
% compartment (1,1), and have ny = "gridSize(1)" x nx = "gridSize(2)" compartments, if it fits in the
% image. If "gridSize" is empty, the grid fills up the image. "GRID" (structure) contains:
%
% GRID.xywh = xywh;
% GRID.Size = gridSize;
% GRID.Overlap = gridOverlap;        % 1.7
% GRID.Centroids = gridCentroids;
% GRID.ULCs = gridULCs;
% GRID.Color = gridColor;
% GRID.LineWidth = gridLineWidth;
% GRID.Coordinates = gridCoordinates; % 1.11
%
% Except for "xywh", "gridSize", "gridOverlap"' "gridColor" and "gridLineWidth", all cell arrays are organized
% similarly (ny rows  * nx col) to the drawn boxes and contains xy coordinates (pixels) of each box
% Upper Left Corner (ULC)(grid_ULCs) and centroid (box_centroids). Display of grid must be carried out
% with "PlotGrid".
%
% NB1: if "boxSize" has only one value, the grid is made of square compartments (w=h)
% NB2: if xyStart = [], default value is xy_start = [image_size(2)/2 image_size(1)/2]
% NB3: Output "box" is only created for compatibility with programs determining Fourier transform of
% images (see below).
% NB4: if grid_overlap = [], it will be set to 0 and saved as such

%% History %%

% 16/10/2018: 1.15
% - fixed bug when "xyStart" was empty.

% 14/06/2017: 1.14
% - put capitals to every quantity "Q" that was called "gridQ" when stored
% in GRID. This to avoid having variable "size" that is also a function.

% 30/11/2017: 1.13
% - fixed bug where the grid asked by user was not respecting "gridSize"
% - fixed bug where program was forcing a larger grid than the one asked by user!

% 14/01/2016: 1.12
% - fixed bug when running in "full image" mode

% 22/12/2015: 1.11: REMOVED "compatibility with Fourier transform" and "box" output (cell array)
% - added field "coordinates" in GRID: cell array that contains coordinates of box compartments in
% units of boxSize and centered on xyStart (for Herve Isamber data formatting and possibly for space
% registration).
% - linear iteration over grid compartments

% 02/06/2015: 1.10 became "GridMaker"
% - changed paramter names

% 24/02/2015: 1.9
% - support of full image processing: builds a 1-box grid covering the whole image when both "xy_start" and "box_size" are BOTH empty
% - storage of logical variable "full_image" in GRID to indicate processing of full image

% 13/10/2014: 1.8
% - now rounds up values of "box_size" and "xy_start" to 0.1 precision since decimal values are now possible due to animal rescaling.

% 07/03/2014: 1.7
% - added storage of "overlap" in GRID structure

% 17/02/2014: 1.6 Anais
% - added grid overlap /!\ number of inputs has changed

% 20/01/2012: 1.5
% - added new input "grid_size" to control number of grid compartments.
% - check for grid validity (empty, or difference with user grid)

% 10/01/2012: 1.4
% - removed the display part and created "Grid_Plotter"
% - accordingly put back "image_size" as input instead of image
% - stores "grid_color, grid_linewidth" in GRID.

% 10/01/2012: 1.3
% - now output is structure "GRID" containing "xywh", "size", "grid_ULCs" and "box_centroids" (both nx*ny cell arrays)
% - new inputs: image (instead of image_size), grid_color, grid_linewidth
% - added back display of box overlayed on image

% 08/02/2011: 1.2
% - removed display of grid and moved it to "Average_Over_Grid"
% - replaced "image" by "image_size" as input (minimal input)
% - replaced "wh_box" by "box_size" as input
% - added "wh_box" as output

% 07/02/2011: creation 1.1 (changed name from "Grid_Tool" to "Grid_Maker")
