 function Tdata = TensorData(T)
%
% Tdata = TensorData(T)
%
% from tensor T cartesian coordinates T = [Txx Txy Tyx Tyy], calculates eigen-values/vectors and stores everything in
% structure "Tdata" that so far contains:
%
% * Es = EIGENVALUES [E1 E2] sorted in ASCENDING order OF *** DEVIATORIC PART OF T, NOT THEIR MODULES ***, (1x2 vector)
%        (Ex: [+2 -2] if T is deviatoric (Eiso =0), [1 -3] if same dev part (namely (1+3)/2*[1 -1] = [+2 -2]) but with Eiso = -1)
%       => the first listed angle always indicates the direction of the + bar (in circle-bar plots)
%
% * Angles = angles (in [-90, 90]) made by each eigenvector with x axis (1x2 vector)

%% History %%

% 08/04/2016: 3.1
% - fixed issue with "mat" becoming a complex matrix becaue of Zs and yielding inaccurate sorting

% 06/08/2015: 3.0
% - now sorts eigenvalues and eigenvectors according to asending eigenvalues of DEVIATORIC PART OF T, namelely
% Edevs(1) > 0 > Edevs(2) = - Edevs(1).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MAJOR CHANGES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 25/02/2015: 2.1 (became TensorData)
% - support of tensors containing NaN of Inf

% 17/02/2015: 2.0: started implementation of new framework
% - use of Vec2Mat
% - removed "minAEV" argument setting a threshold: now angles are ALWAYS calculated, even when meaningless.
% NB: with the "split" representation, it doesn't matter if the angles are ill defined since the bar has nearly 0 length

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NEW FRAMEWORK RENORMALIZATION (TA 2.0+)%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 05/12/2013: 1.3
% - fixed bug when AEs(1)=AEs(2)=0 then ratio = NaN, which was causing a
% bug in "if (1 - rAEs > minAEV) || E1*E2 < 0" since the output was not logical

% 23/07/2013: 1.2
% - changed criterion to assess meaningful angles: now ALWAYS caculate angle when eigenvalues have differents signs (+1 and -1 are very different, although anisotropy = 0)!
% - when angles deemed not meaningful, replaced Angles = [NaN NaN] by [0 90] so that ellipses STILL get displayed

% 19/07/2013: 1.1
% - changed criterion to calculate angle: now using "minAEV" with a RELATIVE criterion (anisotropy between
% eigenvalues) instead of ABSOLUTE criterion on largest eigenvalue.
