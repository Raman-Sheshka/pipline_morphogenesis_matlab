% Determines "macroANs" matching "macroRNs" in the current frame. When some "macroANs" are not found, or have
% corresponding RNs being borderRNs or coalescedRNs in the frame, then found RNs are replaced by NaN in macroRNs.
%
% NB: this requires a specific function (in addition to ANs2RNs) to support cases where macro are lost or fused with the
% border region (that would become all yellow if just using ANs2RNs).
