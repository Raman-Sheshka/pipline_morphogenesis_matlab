function M = MakeMatrix(size,ind,value)
%
% M = MakeMatrix(size,ind,value)
%
% Builds a matrix M of size size(:,1)x size(:,2) with value "value" at indices "ind" and 0s everwhere else.
% Used to rebuild a matrix of image size materializing a single cell (or its contours) in an image out of a column vector of indices.
