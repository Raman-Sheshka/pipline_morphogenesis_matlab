% - added support of "reload_box" option
% - added "image_chosen" as output

% 05/08/2011: 1.2
% - added possibility to draw a box from "predefined_box_data", added as argument
% - minor bug fixes when not selecting a proper box or not selecting image

% 09/02/2011: 1.1
% - defined structure BOX

% 26/11/2010:
% - added box_choice, box_XY as outputs
% - removed "box_matrix_border" in rectangle case
% - in choice 1, defined box_matrix_in as full image instead of NaN
% - carry out box plot even in Full frame case
