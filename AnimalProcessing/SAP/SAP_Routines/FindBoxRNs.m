%% History %%

% 23/07/2017: 1.5 became "BoxRNsFinder" (from "Box_RNs_Finder")
% - renamed variables & removed commented parts

% 07/03/2014: 1.4
% - commented part displaying warning when a grid compartment is found empty
% - commented part determining all cells within grid and removed second output accordingly

% 30/01/2014: 1.3
% - Going over the box limits of 1/2 pixel in all directions to leave out no cells between compartments
% - fixed mistake by calculating this_x/y_max using this_box_ULCs(1/2) instead of this_x/y_min


% 22/01/2014: 1.2
% - corrected mistake leading to one pixel overlap between boxes: replaced "this_x_max = this_x_min + xywh(3)" by "this_x_max = this_x_min + xywh(3) - 1" (same for y axis)
