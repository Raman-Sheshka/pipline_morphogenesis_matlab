% AverageOverSpace (AOS)
%
% Will perform the AVERAGE OVER CORE CELLS (no longer the SUM as of 3.19) of cell STATIC quantities (inertia I, texture M, cortical
% distribution CD) treating each image independently in each compartment of an Eulerian OR Lagrangian grid.
%
% NB: for Lagrangian grid, requires the existence of TA backups for corresponding grid before running
%
% NB: added calculation of rates (f = frame #) (3.25); 1/2 factor (5.5)
% - for some state-function quantities (like Rho, PatchArea, M...): rQ(f) = 1/2 * 1/dtH * [Q(f)-Q(f-1)]/Q(f-1)
%   NB: importantly, taking frame f, one has correspondence with TA backups: for instance, G(f) (namely G stored in backup
%   #f) matches rQ(f) (changes that occurred between f-1 & f).
%
% - for dynamic quantites that can only be measured between two time points (like nA, nD...).
%   In this case dnA = nA(f-1 -> f)/dtH
%   NB: dQ(f) = [Q(f)-Q(f-1)]/dtH => rQ(f) = dQ(f)/Q(f-1);
%
% - "rPatchArea" is zero with E grids as the patch area is taken
% to be the square box size that does not vary in time. One cannot just
% use the same formula as for L grids since in E grids the set of cells
% within a box often vary between two time points as it is just based on
% cell positions with respect to the box, and the cumulated cell area vary
% accordingly.

% IMPROVEMENTS/KNOWN ISSUES:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% - define reliable variations of patch areas and anisotropy to be compared
% to G. NB: to do this, critical to only consider the same set of cells
% from one frame to the other.
% - check density by manually calculating it separately
% - check E and L area ratios
% - comment saving of "CellU" and "ResetXYs" (used for Epsilon debug purposes)
% - in elongated patches with substantial rotation, Epsilon values can be inaccurate!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% 07/02/2019: 6.4
% - added "CellArea" in "rateQs"

% 31/10/2018: 6.3
% - STOPPED cropping patch for Epsilon calcuation because, even after
% fixing the determination of the circle radius to crop, was still
% introducing too much noise => in elongated patches with substantial
% rotation, Epsilon values can be inaccurate!
% - implemented calculation of "AreaDisorder"

% 27/09/2018: 6.2
% - fixed Epsilon issue: now cropping cell patch used to calculate Epsilon
% to a DISK because the anisotropy of the patch can substantially bias the
% linear fits used to calculate it (example of rotating elliptic patch of
% cells processed in simulation W02).
% - added saving of "CellU" and "ResetXYs" for Epsilon debug purposes

% 06/09/2018: 6.1
% - determination of R2 coefficients to assess quality of linear fit to
% determine velocity gradient within each region (gridR2, stored as R2 in GRID_AOS)

% 24/07/2018: 6.0
% - implemented Kabla-Blanchard calculation of patch velocity "U",
% infinitesimal strain rate "Epsilon" and infinitesimal rotation rate "Omega".

% 19/07/2018: 5.5
% - "BoxCellArea" became "PatchArea" ("rBoxCellArea" -> "rPatchArea")
% - % added 1/2 factor for rates "rQ"
% NB: 1/2 factor comes from the fact that, for an isotropic expansion,
% tissue strain E = 1/2*(Af/Ai - 1) = 1/2*rPatchArea, A being the patch area.

% 15/06/2018: 5.4
% - STOPPED renormalizing dnA and dnD by "nCoreRNsGridTime" or any other
% cell number because it is VERY DIFFICULT at AOS stage to chose a time to
% use for this renormalization.
% - accordingly removed parameter "nCoreRNsGridTime" and its saving in in
% GridDef backup.

% 14/06/2018: 5.3
% - now renormalizing dnA, dnD quantities with number of cells in each
% compartment at "gridTime" and NOT "startTime"
% - now saving "nCoreRNsGridTime" in GridDef backup if not already there
% - now also storing "nCoreRNs" in backups saved at each timepoint to be
% able to average it in AOT and AOA
% - Stopped specifying "Avg" in some quantities: "AvgCellArea" became
% "CellArea"; "AvgCellIaniso" became "CellIaniso"

% 04/05/2018: 5.2
% - use of "GetCellCategories" to extract "coreRNs", "FLRNs", "borderRNs"

% 24/04/2018: 5.1 (stephane)
% - add new values AvgCellArea, AvgCellIaniso, ...
% - normalize dnD and dnA by the number of cell per box defined at starting frame

% 08/02/2018: 5.0
% - adjustments to match new function names and new programs
% - totally removed the display part (was NOT up to date anyway)
% - accordingly removed parameter "replotAOS"
% - now skipping calculation when backup is found. Loading existing backup
% when next one is missing to define OLD quantities.
% - dtH = dt/60 is now defined in AIA_parameters

% 27/09/2017: 4.3
% - removed many commented parts to clean up code
% - replaced "CppTFolder" by "trackingFolder" to match AIA_parameters v7.3
% - fixed mistake (factor 2) that used to count divided daughters rather than divisions!

% 25/09/2017: 4.2
% - removed commented parts that used to define and validate grid
% - adjustments to work with shorter backup filenames of SIA

% 25/07/2017: 4.1 *CHANGES TO ADAPT TO CPT 3.5*
% - removed "today" now defined in AIA_parameters

% 23/07/2017: 4.0 **NOW USING CPT BACKUPS FOR LAGRANGIAN GRIDS**
% - improving similarity between "E" or "L" grid treatements
% - in "L" grid mode, cells in each box compartments are now determined before in CPT (and no longer by TA)
% - "Lcentroids" and "contourIndices" are no longer save here but are now saved by CPT
% - stopped saving backups in a sub-backup "GRID_AOS" but directly in the .m file
% - stopped creating "frameFolder" when no images saved

% 15/03/2017:
% - put "gridTag" BEFORE "olapTag" in "gridSpecs" (like it is in TA and elsewhere)

% 16/07/2016: 3.25
% - changed name of cortical distributions now using "signalName" => CD1 -> "CDcad" for instance
% - did the same for "A_wt2NEW" that becomes "Acad"

% 16/07/2016: 3.25 BETA
% - checked calculation of cell density Rho
% - added storage of "BoxCellArea" matrix (mostly relevant for L grid)
% - added rates for Rho and BoxCellArea: rQ(F) = [Q(F)-Q(F-1)]/[dtH*Q(F-1)]
% NB: importantly, taking frame F, one has correspondence with TA backups: for instance, G(F) (namely G stored in backup
% #F) matches rQ(F) (changes that occurred between F-1 & F).
% - corrected the badly defined nA and nD (they were NOT divided by dtH) into dnA and dnD since they are intrinsically
% quantities that are measured between time points and canNOT be measured at a given timepoint (unlike the other
% quantities Rho, M...). In this case dnA = nA(F-1 -> F)/dtH
% NB: dQ(F) = [Q(F)-Q(F-1)]/dtH => rQ(F) = dQ(F)/Q(F-1);


% 12/07/2016: 3.24
% - added instantaneous number of delaminatING cells (nA) and of dividED cells (nD) in GRID_AOS (Lagrangian only)
% - displays final image for eulerian grids and first image for lagrangian ones
% - removed calls to "background_removal" and "printResolutionOR"

% 24/06/2016: 3.23
% - now saves cortical distributions named CD1, CD2 to make the AOT processing closer to GEP (ID1,ID2...) and enable averages over animals
% - linear iteration over grid compartments

% 28/04/2016: 3.22
% - removed argument "temperature" in "frame2time/time2frame" since "dt" is now corrected at "AIA_parameter" stage

% 11/04/2016:
% - fixed hybrid case where scale1D and not (scale_1D) is stored in FRAME from SIA

% 03/06/2015: 3.21
% - supports loading of old SIA backups

% 02/06/2015: 3.20
% - M,I,V,CD have become 3D matrices containing cartesian "XY" coordinates of tensors: not diagonalizing and saving Es and Angles anymore.
% - changes made in 3.18, 3.19 and 3.20 significantly simplified the code
% - removed many comments

% 02/06/2015: 3.19 ONLY CALCULATING AVERAGE QUANTITIES Rho, I, M, V, CD!
% - stopped calculating sum "Q" quantities to only keep mean "mQ" quantities (average over CORE cells in grid compartments).
% - renamed "mQ" quantities to "Q": mI,mM,mV,mCD became M,I,V,CD.
% - saving txt file indicating which version of AOS was used

% 29/05/2015: 3.18 LAGRANGIAN GRID SUPPORT + HARMONIZATION OF AreaRatios CALCULATION!
% - support of Lagrangian grid: loading TA backups
% - harmonized the way AreaRatios are calculated: use of "Normalizer" to calculate them for both E and L grids

% 27-29/05/2015: 3.17
% - changed many parameter names to match AIA 6.0
% - PLOTS CAN ONLY BE MADE IN REPLOT MODE
% - skips execution when last backup is found
% - added progress bar

% 14/01/2015: 3.16
% - handles when "display_AOS" is empty
% - stopped displaying warnings when no core cells was found in the compartment
% - removed some commented lines

% 14/10/2014: 3.15
% - improved definition & creation of paths, now using "Path_folder_AOS" and "Filename_AOS" defined in AIA_parameters

% 09/10/2014: 3.14
% - changed naming of figures to "Q_animal_frame_Tr=0_sr=0.X.png" so they are sorted by quantity first, then by frame number
% - exception when Q=(m)CD: do not repeat signal name if only one signal processed to avoid repeating the animal name.

% 08/10/2014: 3.13
% - removed "|| ~replotAOS" so that "grid_validation_AOS" is the only parameter used to validate grid
% - fixed bug when all core cells in box have all NaNs for polarity modes
% - stopped defining "fade_color" and "time_color" now that they can be automatically generated in "PlotField"

% 04/10/2014:
% - use of "AllQsColorsUnits" file to load all_Qs, all_colors, all_units
% - took out all format, resolution parameters to AIA_parameters

% 29/09/2014: 3.12 CHANGED NAME TO "Average Over Space"
% - definition of vector "kill_mean_trace_AOS" that specifies whether trace should be removed
% - use of function "PlotField" for all plots, displays info of removed trace
% - STOPPED using "scale1D" anylonger for M,I plots since they are in micromiter^2

% 21/09/2014: 3.11
% - introduced parameter "kill_mean_trace_AOG" to plot CD tensors without average trace by removing the weighted average over all compartments of
% their trace. Relevant when tensors are known up to an additive constant or to look at relative values of their isotropic part.
% - uses AreaRatios to blend tensor color with background color to make lesss accurate boundary contributions less visible.

% 17/09/2014:
% - always prompt user for grid validation in NON-replot mode, regardless of "grid_validation_AOG" parameter value.

% 23/07/2014: 3.10
% - use of filesep for mac compatibility

% 09/04/2014: 3.9.1
% - compatibility with overlapping grids "GridMaker" (1.7) and new "Tensor_Plotter" (1.7) displaying signs with disk transparency
% - includes grid overlap in name folder
% - now fading segmented image to improve tensor display

% 25/02/2014: 3.9
% - Now allows plot of characterizations of each protein cortical distribution with different colors using new AIA parameter "CD_colors_AOG".

% 29/01/2014: 3.8
% - test presence of core cell centroid in box before assigning non-zero AreaRatio value in this box
% - now defines list of indices of core cells and core cell sides BEFORE loop on grid compartements, hence speeding up code

% 23/01/2014: 3.7
% - now both computes, store and plots SUM AND MEAN over cells for all quantities in each compartments (Q and mQ)
% - accordingly, list of possible quantities to plot extended to: {'Rho' ; 'I' ; 'mI'; 'M' ; 'mM' ;  'V' ;  'mV' ;'CD' ; 'mCD' };
% - display of exectution time for grid processing ("no replot" mode)

% 22/01/2014: 3.6
% - added storage of matrices of number (nCoreCells) and density (Rho, in nb_cells/?m2 if scale1D in ?m/pixel) of cells in grid compartments in GRID_AOG
% - storage of BoxArea (in pixels) and scale1D
% - change name of quantity quantifying cortical distribution to CD from P
% - added treatment and plot of vertex distribution tensor V
% - plot of density (Rho) map

% 22/01/2014: 3.5
% - thorough recalculation of AreaRatios matrix with AreaCellsFull now including the fractions of AREAS AND EDGES of core cells => value = 1 when the box is full of core
% cells, lower value as soon as the box contains a fraction of first-layer edge or cell.
% - accordingly removed renormalization of AreaRatios to get max value = 1
% - removed comments on previous ways of storing XYs, Es and Angles in Ms,Is,Ps and plotting info on maps

% 21/01/2014: 3.4
% - now indicates the grid size (ny*nx) in directory name (matching TA): ...'_nynx_' num2str(ny) 'x' num2str(nx)];) to avoid loading of wrong backups
% with same xy_start and wh but different nx,ny.
% - finalized and tested changes with cortical distribution (P, to be renamed CD)

% 17/01/2014: 3.3
% - set all "Border_parameter" to "tight"
% - use of "Info_Plotter" to plot info about quantity plotted, time, animal and scalebar
% - loading of last image to validate grid instead of 1st image
% - removed some commented parts (older parts of code)
% - change the way tensor data are stored in GRID_AOG: now M,I are structures that each contain nx*ny matrix/arrays: "XYs", "Es" and "Angles" (matching STP analysis)

% 17/01/2014: 3.2
% - now calling "Tensor_Plotter" instead of "Tensor_Plotter_BETA"
% - defined "grid_core_cellRNs" that only contains Core_cells
% - removed renormalization of tensor values by AreaCells/BoxArea and created instead a new array "AreaRatios" (BASED ON CORE CELLS) containing this value in each grid compartment.
% NB: since the SUM of M, I was used instead of the AVERAGE (as of 3.1), there was a "implicit" renormalization and it did NOT need the extra renormalization by AreaCells/BoxArea

% 12/11/2013: 3.1 REPLACED AVERAGE BY SUM IN COMPARTMENTS
% - now uses "BoxRNsFinder" to determine cell numbers in each compartment
% - fixed bug when some grid compartments are empty
% - changed display_AOG to display_AOG{1} when comparing it to 'none' or 'all'
% - if no intensity was computed in SIA, removes polarity P from possible quantities to plot
% - REPLACED AVERAGE BY SUM IN COMPARTMENTS BECAUSE I,M WERE DECREASING SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME SINCE CELLS BECOME SMALLER.
% - ONLY KEEPS IMAGE CORE CELLS TO MAKE SUM IN GRID COMPARTMENTS (TEXTURE M NOT ACCURATE OTHERWISE)

% 26/07/2013: 3.0.6
% - not creating directories if grid not validated

% 25/07/2013: 3.0.5
% - addition of scale bar displaying scale and scale ratio (see TA)

% - implementation replot mode

% 23/07/2013: 3.0.2
% - finalization fof display of polarities

% 18/07/2013: 3.0.1
% - solving of the NaN bug that killed the mean of polarity modes in some grid compartments
% - addition of average of Inertia tensor
% - revamp of display with circle and bar (using Tensor_Plotter 1.4+)

% 5/12/2012: 2.2
% - calculates "mean_cellIs", the average I0,I1,I2 over single cells to get average polarization of single cells
% - display figure showing "mean_cellIs"

% 3/12/2012: 2.1
% - now doing averages AGAIN instead of sum that depend on the number of cell within each compartment

% 28/11/2012: 2.0
% - adaptation to changes made in all functions used and to support several raw images as input

% 09/02/2011: 1.1
% - added xy_start (when not empty) in the folder name.
% - added check of "backgroundRemoval" value
% - moved several display parameters to AIA
% - grid displayed only if "Grid_display = 1"
% - added 'LineStyle',line_style to grid drawing
% - only one number of digits specified now: "digits" + "digit_format" now defined in AIA.

% 07/02/2011: creation and renaming to "Average_Over_Grid" (previously Grid_Average)
