%% History %%

% - MUST CHECK CELLS SELECTED IN GRID COMPARTMENTS

% KNOWN BUGS:
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% - Remove the part making plots (for coherence with AOS)??
% - bug on frame 165 of TRBL8 for unknown reason:
%             Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals.
%             Error in StressMap (line 288)
%                                 ST_xx = sum( T(Ens_box).*EdXs(Ens_box).*EdXs(Ens_box)./EDs(Ens_box) )/Acells_box; % renormalization by
%                                 Acells_box instead of Abox (3.7)
% Checked that Ens_box starts with 0
% ATTEMPTED FIX in 3.11:
% Ens_box = Ens_box(Ens_box > 0);         % removes possible 0s remaining (3.11)
% NB: the only case encountered with a 0 listed in "Ens_box" came from TRBL8 #165 where there is a round cell with only 2
% vertices!! For an unclear reason, this lead one of the neighboring cell having a list of edges going beyond nJmax that
% normally sets the width of the CEs matrix, adding a whole new column of 0s in CEs (after all the NaNs normally
% completing the matrix). Then, where removing NaNs, those 0s remain in Ens_box.
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% 25/04/2019: 4.3
% - updated path to segmented image for display within SM

% 21/05/2019: 4.2
% - defined upper bound on allowed number of edges per cell "nEdgesMax" = 20 to
% fix a bug (on animal "pnrg4_white_1") where a cell had 60 edges (which is
% already non-sense) and only 59 vertices (unknown reason)!
% - added +1 to number of columns as a quick fix for the bug adding a
% column of 0s in CEs because sometimes, one cell has a larger number of
% juctions than size(CJs,2) for an unknown reason.
       
% 28/02/2018: 4.1
% - changes to adapt to Matlab 2017 and new varialbe and function names
% - changes to get STPE backups from their new folders (stopped trying to
% load older versions of backups)
% - updated display of maps (skipping image already exists)

% 10/10/2017: 4.0 **NOW USING CPT BACKUPS FOR LAGRANGIAN GRIDS**
% - removed grid validation step that is now in AIA_parameters
% - improved similarity between "E" or "L" grid treatements
% - in BOTH "L" & "E" grid modes, cells in each box compartments are now determined before in CPT (and no longer by TA)
% - "Lcentroids" and "contourIndices" are no longer saved here but are now saved by CPT
% - stopped saving backups in a sub-backup "GRID_SM" but directly in the .m file
% - stopped creating "frameFolder" when no images saved
% - removed parameter "replotSM": either found OR calculates SM backup and plot if "makePlotsSM = true"
% - determining macroRNs in each image to color them in PlotField

% 13/01/2017: 3.18
% - use of "gridFrame" to plot corresponding image for grid validation
% - added gridTag specifying gridTime in gridSpecs folder name

% 15/09/2016: 3.17
% - adjusments to support the loading of new STPE backups from STPE v3.0+ and older ones from STPE 2.11+ (BUT NOT before)
% - plots now support of unique "uniqueScaleRatioSM" and "uniqueScaleBarLengthSM" specified in AIA_info
% - in the "Map display" section replaced "replotSM" by "makePlotsSM" to avoid having to rerun SM for plots
% - linear iteration on grid compartments using nBoxes
% - better support of "fullImage" mode
% - fixed bug printing a piece of the progressbar (instead of the grid) and NOT closing the grid figure

% 09/06/2016: 3.16
% - display of FIRST image with lagrangian (to see which patch was selected initially) grid and LAST with Eulerian (to see how empty some
% compartments will get)

% 28/04/2016: 3.15
% - removed argument "temperature" in "frame2time/time2frame" since "dt" is now corrected at "AIA_parameter" stage

% 01/06/2015: 3.14
% - additional changes in parameter names
% - initializing "AreaRatios" and "nShujiCells" with zeros rather than NaNs
% - now using 3D matrices to save ST,S
% - saving txt file indicating which version of SM was used
% - skipping execution when last SM backup is found
% - added initiation of progressbar (updated in AIA parameters)

% 29/05/2015: 3.13
% - changed many parameter names to match AIA 6.0
% - using parameter "normalizeMethod" in "Normalizer" defined in AIA parameters

% 08/04/2015: 3.12 LAGRANGIAN GRID SUPPORT
% - support of Lagrangian grid: loading TA backups and MSM backups
% - using "Normalizer" to normalize AreaRatios in EGrid mode
% - removed parts commented in 3.10

% 16/10/2014: 3.11
% - attempted to fix the TRBL8#165 bug (see right above), but realized the problem was even bigger in STPE where mu=0 is found for this frame.

% 14/10/2014: 3.10
% - turned "P" and "SP" into scalars, as it should be
% - use of "filenameSM"

% 08/10/2014: 3.9: adjustments for integration into AIA workflow
% - use of "AllQsColorsUnits" and "PlotField" to plot stress maps which simplified the code
% - support older STPE backups (STPE 2.10-), BUT saves everything in new SM format
% - "BU_found" became "BackupFound"
% - Frame filenames now start with quantity plotted

% 18/09/2014: 3.8
% - introduced parameter "killMeanTraceSM" to plot tensors by removing
% the weighted average over all compartments of their trace since their
% isotropic part is only known up to an additive constant.
% - use of newly created functions "TraceMatrix" and "WeightedMean" to do so.

% 15/09/2014: 3.7
% - now saves "Ncells" and "AreaRatios" in backups (required for Anais
% correlation plots and to weight border boxes)
% - stopped renormalizing stress by Abox, but by Acells_box, sum of areas
% of cells in the box
% - now only consider non-Ext cells in boxes

% 12/09/2014: 3.6
% - now creates classic tree view with folder SM_EGrid_animal, subfolder with
% Grid specs, and subfolders Backups and Frames_split+,_dev+ according to "plot_typeSM"

% 23/07/2014: 3.5
% - use of filesep for mac compatibility

% 09/05/2014: 3.4
% - added "grid_overlap" in GridMaker
% - added plot of midline with "Midline_Plotter([], yMid)"
% - use of "Tensor_Plotter" 1.7 with "sign_opacitiesSM"
% - use of "Info_Plotter"
% - added many comments in the "renormalization by scale1D" section
% - added "StressMap" at beginning of subfolder name
% - added number of compartments nx,ny and value of overlap at the end of subfolder name

% 12/11/2013: 3.3
% - directly closes grid image after validation if in replot mode

% 14/10/2013: 3.2
% - normalization of stress by box compartment area Abox = w*h instead of sum(cell areas)
% - changed EdYs sign globally before stress computation to be consistent with "ij" axis convention used in image AND in tensor analysis.
% - added mean pressure P in GRID_SM
% - implemented replot mode
% - display of quantity plotted, animal and frame #

% 26/09/2013: 3.1: STARTING MAJOR OVERHAUL OF THE CODE
% - removed all parts involving time averaging
% - thoroughly rewrote parts caculating stress, removing all loops except the one over compartment grids

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 19/09/2013: renaming to "StressMap" from "FastStressMap"

% 15/05/2013: 3.0 and renaming to "FastStressMap" from "FastGlobalStress_Run_Force_Estimate_PT_time_averaging" (!!)

% 22/03/2013:
% - Calculates and saves "DensiteMoy"
% - Calculates and saves "EllipsesPnp"

% 18/03/2013:
% - Saves the calculation results in "image name".mat
% - Replot mode, runs plot_PT_ellipses

% 25/02/2013: changed name to "FastGlobalStress_Run_Force_Estimate_PT_time_averaging"
% - averaging on time. Run by "run_Force_Estimate_PT_time_averaging".

% 12/11/2012: 2.0
% - initiated changes for compatibility with "FastGetData" outputs

% 26/09/2012: 1.1
% - changed inputs: GlobalStress(T,P,cell,edge,x,y) to GlobalStress(ep,cell,edge,x,y,scale) so that one just needs to
% load out.m file to run
% - added plot
