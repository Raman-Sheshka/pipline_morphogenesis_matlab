% MatlabShujiMatcher (MSM)
%
% This program will match Shuji and Matlab relative numbers of vertices (Vs), cells (Cs) and edges (Es). The
% program starts by matching vertex numbers based on their exact XY coordinates, then matches cell numbers based on
% their exact vertex list first, then rescue the unfound ones by allowing a match if 2 cells share at least
% "min_n_vertices". Finally, it matches edges based on vertex numbers previously matched.
% The output is a mat file "Animal_XXX_MS_match.mat" that contains 2 column matrices:
% Matlab-Shuji match: Vs_MS_match, Cs_MS_match, Es_MS_match.
% Shuji-Matlab match: Vs_SM_match, Cs_SM_match, Es_SM_match.
% if "check_MS_match" = 1 in "STP_Estimate_runner", an image displayig Matlab and Shuji cell numbers at cell exact
% centroid (Matlab) and at average vertex positions (Shuji) will be saved. Unmatched vertices, cells and edges are
% displayed in red. Rescued cells are displayed in green.
%
% NB: Runs through "STP_Estimate_runner" where parameters should be specified in the "MSM" section.
% NB: STP backups (run in "fast/sparse" mode) are required to run this script.
% NB: LISTS OF CELLS AND VERTICES ARE ALWAYS LONGER IN MATLAB SINCE THEY CONTAIN ALL SEGMENTED CELLS
% NB: It is a complete overhaul of Anaelle Pierre preliminary program (restarted from scratch).

%% History %%

% Possible improvements:
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% - vertex rescue based on cell identity that should be done after having determined "Cs_MS/SM_match" ?
% - edge rescue based on cell identity ? caution though because unmatched edges involve a wrong vertex that belong
% to the neighboring cell: not sure this can work
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% NB: as of v2.4, unmatched vertices and edges are rare and should only involve external ("Ext") ones

% 02/05/2018: 2.15
% - changes to adapt to new C++SIA: now vertex and side numbers NO LONGER
% CORRESPOND TO THEIR ROW NUMBERS!!
% - using "positionFullScreen" to display figure bigger on screen.
% - fixed the update of solved cell Shuji's numbers after recovery
% - removed several commented parts

% 27/02/2018: 2.14
% - update to match with new variables and function names
% - does NOT support the loading of older STPE backups
% - display of MSM images also works

% 12/10/2017: 2.13
% - do NOT recalculates backups when they already exist

% 10/10/2017: 2.12
% - minor adjustments to match new names of SIA backups

% 15/02/2017
% - using "filename_fn" rather than "filename" that used to overwrite the one from AIA_info

% 15/09/2016: 2.11
% - adjusments to support the loading of new STPE backups from STPE v3.0+ and older ones from STPE 2.11+ (BUT NOT before)

% 10/09/2015: 2.10
% - now directly looking for existence of "scale_1D" in FRAME to detect old backups (instead of "image_size" WTF??!)

% 28/05/2015: 2.9
% - changed many parameter names to match AIA 6.0

% 16/10/2014: 2.8
% - decreased thickness of unmatched edges from 3x to 2x regular thickness
% - possibility to enter a list of Matlab and Shuji cell numbers to highlight in magenta
% - solved mismatch between the displayed and actual number of umatched edges

% 08/10/2014: 2.7: adjustments for integration into AIA workflow
% - creation of specific MSM folder and subfolders for Backups and Frames
% - changed naming of figures and backup files ('MSM_animal_frame.mat/png")
% - support of old STPE backups (STPE 2.10-)

% 23/07/2014: 2.6
% - use of filesep for mac compatibility

% 06/03/2014: 2.5
% - fixed bug to display in red an umatched cell: now displaying "S.XXX" on the map, XXX being this cell Shuji number

% 05/03/2014: 2.4 WORKS
% - implemented edge match based on vertex numbers, obviously using Vs_MS/SM_match
% - made reverse match for vertices, cells and edges: saves "Shuji-Matlab" matrices in addition to  "Matlab-Shuji" matrices
% - display of unmatched edges in thick red
% - removed commented part implementing vertex rescue that was based on tolerance in the difference of XY
% coordinates (see below)

% 04/03/2014: 2.3 WORKS
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% NB: the origin of the issue mentionned below (unmatched vertices) was due to the fact that getVertex was modifying the segmented image
% before processing it using "sunnyremover", "Four_Pixel_Vertex_Removal". Hence the difference in vertex
% coordinates: some core vertices were just NOT the same.
% Now, the segmented image is no longer changed in getVertex: before it should had gone through "Four_Pixel_Block_Filter"
% that now removes ALL of these 4pixels blocks!!
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% - removed rescue round for vertices (see above)
% - finalized the cell identity check (when parameter "check_MS_match" = 1) and the associated image "..._MS_match.png"
% - check for existence of SIA and STP backup files before pursuing: files with missing backups are skipped
% - fixed bug where "Cs_S_missing" was not set to [] when all cells were matched right away
% - improved messages displayed in command window

% 19/02/2014: 2.2
% - implemented a rescue for unmatched vertices but found out that they were never found because eligible vertices
% have always been already matched!

% 18/02/2014: 2.1
% - finalized Matlab-Shuji matching of vertex AND cell numbers
% - now finds a match for nearly every vertex and cell number listed by Shuji (not leaving out "Ext" cells)
% - drastically improved speed (BIGwt2 #9 used to take 183s = 3 min, now only takes 4.5s!!!)
% - removing parts commented in 2.0

% 17/02/2014: 2.0 restarting from scratch

% 17/02/2014: 1.2
% - simlifying and removing useless lines of code and loops
% - Anaelle used too many useless lines, did not take advantage of the way data and backup are structured => major overhaul needed

% 17/02/2014: 1.1 (changed name to "Matlab_Shuji_Matcher") RUNS
% - adjustments to make it run from STP_Estimate_runner

% 19/09/2013: changed name to "Matlab_Shuji_match" from "correspondance_matlab_block"

% 15/03/2013: creation
