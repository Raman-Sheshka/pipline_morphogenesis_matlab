sizeImageYext = ceil(min(sizeImageYmin * (1+leeway), sizeImageYmin + 2 * DISPLAY.boxSize(2)));
% NB: Adding leeway so as NOT to start grid at [0,0] but further from image border and still fit it in image

% setting final leeway:
leewayPixX = sizeImageXext - sizeImageXmin; % image extra pixels along X
leewayPixY = sizeImageYext - sizeImageYmin; % image extra pixels along Y

sizeImageXreg = sizeImageXext;
sizeImageYreg = sizeImageYext;

% Setting new origin
% % ACTUAL new origin in image:
newOxReg = DISPLAY.boxSize(1) * (oIJc(2)-1) * (1 - gridOverlap) + leewayPixX/2;
newOyReg = DISPLAY.boxSize(2) * (oIJc(1)-1) * (1 - gridOverlap) + leewayPixY/2;
% meanYmidReg = newOyReg - meanDeltaYmid; % 2.5
% NB: subtracting "PLOT.boxSize" because box origin is normally at ULC of box => subtraction of one full box width/height

% Build global common REGULAR grid
% since using gridSize to keep previous size, need to determine grid new ULC in extended image (2.7)
